<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Designed and implemented a secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to enable user registration login and session management. Users can securely create an account by providing their credentials and upon successful registration a unique JWT is generated and sent back to the client. Integrated advanced hashing algorithms and encryption techniques to securely store user passwords in the database. Token-based authentication allows users to access protected routes and perform CRUD operations on their notes.

*   Implemented a robust API to handle CRUD operations for note management in the Node.js project. Users can easily add new notes by sending a POST request to the appropriate endpoint. The note is securely stored in the database and associated with the user's account.

*   A feature to view all notes is provided allowing users to retrieve and see a comprehensive overview of their saved information. Incorporated functionality to update existing notes enabling users to modify and refine their note content as needed. Users can send a PUT request to update a specific note.

*   Ensured the safety and privacy of user data by implementing a delete operation for notes. Users can send a DELETE request to remove a specific note from their collection.
*   Enhanced user experience by providing alert messages for successful operations such as user registration login note addition and updates or deletions. Ensured security by implementing a session-based approach requiring users to log back in after logging out to prevent unauthorized access.
